## special tag name

There are some special tag names that are used for special meaning.

- ##. Indicates that this record is annotated and will never be exported
- unchecked. Indicates that the validator does not check this record

## Record filter export

There are several occasions where filter export is used

- Some records are only used for internal testing and do not want to be exported for official release
- Some records want different versions for testing and publishing
- Some simple multi-version management, such as a record is only exported in a certain version or branch

Use the command line parameter `--includeTag` or `--excludeTag` to include or exclude the data of the specified tag. The following is an example of usage.

| ##var  | id   | name   |                                         |
| ------ | ---- | ------ | --------------------------------------- |
| ##type | int  | string |                                         |
| ##     | id   | desc1  | comment                                 |
|        | 1    | item1  | export forever                          |
| ##     | 2    | item2  | never export                            |
| test   | 4    | item4  | --excludeTag do not export when testing |
| TEST   | 5    | item5  | Do not export when --excludeTag test    |
| dev    | 6    | item6  | --excludeTag dev does not export        |
|        | 7    | item7  | export forever                          |
